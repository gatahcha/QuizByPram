const e="FNH 200 - Chapter 2: Nutrition Basics",n="Comprehensive quiz covering fundamental nutrition concepts, macronutrients, micronutrients, and dietary guidelines",i=[{question:"Which of the following is NOT a macronutrient?",options:["Carbohydrates","Proteins","Vitamins","Fats"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Vitamins are micronutrients, not macronutrients. The three macronutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Macronutrients are needed in large amounts and provide energy, while micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) are needed in smaller amounts."},{question:"How many calories does 1 gram of carbohydrate provide?",options:["2 calories","4 calories","7 calories","9 calories"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Carbohydrates provide 4 calories per gram. Proteins also provide 4 calories per gram, while fats provide 9 calories per gram (the most energy-dense macronutrient). Alcohol, though not a nutrient, provides 7 calories per gram."},{question:"What is the primary function of protein in the body?",options:["Provide immediate energy","Store energy for later use","Build and repair tissues","Regulate body temperature"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"The primary function of protein is to build and repair body tissues. Proteins are made up of amino acids and are essential for growth, maintenance, and repair of cells. While protein can be used for energy, this is not its primary role."},{question:"Which vitamin is produced by the body when exposed to sunlight?",options:["Vitamin A","Vitamin C","Vitamin D","Vitamin E"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin when exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from sunlight. This is why it's sometimes called the 'sunshine vitamin.' It plays a crucial role in calcium absorption and bone health."},{question:"What is the difference between complete and incomplete proteins?",options:["Complete proteins are plant-based, incomplete are animal-based","Complete proteins contain all essential amino acids, incomplete proteins lack one or more","Complete proteins have more calories than incomplete proteins","There is no difference; all proteins are the same"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Complete proteins contain all nine essential amino acids in adequate amounts. Animal sources (meat, eggs, dairy) are typically complete proteins. Incomplete proteins lack one or more essential amino acids and are usually plant-based, though combining different plant proteins can provide all essential amino acids."},{question:"What is the recommended daily water intake for most adults?",options:["2-4 cups (500-1000 mL)","4-6 cups (1000-1500 mL)","8-10 cups (2000-2500 mL)","12-15 cups (3000-3750 mL)"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Most adults should aim for about 8-10 cups (2000-2500 mL) of water daily, though individual needs vary based on activity level, climate, and health status. The classic '8 glasses a day' guideline is a good general rule, but actual needs can be higher for active individuals."},{question:"Which of the following is a water-soluble vitamin?",options:["Vitamin A","Vitamin D","Vitamin K","Vitamin C"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Vitamin C is water-soluble, meaning it dissolves in water and excess amounts are excreted in urine rather than stored. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble and can be stored in body fat and the liver. Water-soluble vitamins need to be consumed more regularly."},{question:"What is the primary storage form of carbohydrates in the human body?",options:["Glucose","Glycogen","Starch","Cellulose"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Glycogen is the storage form of carbohydrates in animals and humans, primarily stored in the liver and muscles. When blood glucose levels drop, glycogen can be broken down into glucose. Starch is the storage form in plants, while cellulose is a structural component in plants."},{question:"Which mineral is most important for oxygen transport in the blood?",options:["Calcium","Iron","Zinc","Sodium"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Iron is crucial for oxygen transport as it's a key component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to body tissues. Iron deficiency can lead to anemia, characterized by fatigue and weakness due to insufficient oxygen delivery."},{question:"What does the term 'nutrient density' refer to?",options:["The weight of nutrients in food","The ratio of nutrients to calories in food","The number of different nutrients in food","The concentration of fat in food"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Nutrient density refers to the amount of nutrients a food contains relative to its calorie content. Foods high in nutrient density provide substantial vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial substances with relatively few calories. Examples include vegetables, fruits, and lean proteins."}],t={title:e,description:n,questions:i};export{t as default,n as description,i as questions,e as title};
